PROJECT TITLE: Capstone (Chess)
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To explore java and create a program using knowledge gained this year

DEPENDENCIES:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method of Board
AUTHORS: Jalen Smith
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Click on a piece you wish to move and click moveTo(). Input location and play away.


OVERVIEW: This is an OOP version of a chess game running in GridWorld.
It allows the user to move pieces, take pieces, place pieces, remove pieces and play a completely functional game of chess. 
However, it does not have the rules part built in completely yet.

SYNTHESIS: It pulls in OOP, Gridworld, GUI, Decisions and Loops, as well as inheritance.

OTHER: Although the rules arent 100% done, the King can move it's normal amount of spaces and can only take black pieces. Other than check/checkmate, it is fully finished.
